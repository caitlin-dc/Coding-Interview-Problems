<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/">205. Isomorphic Strings</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>Given an array of integers <code>nums</code>&nbsp;and an integer <code>target</code>, return <em>indices of the two numbers such that they add up to <code>target</code></em>.</p>

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
